# How it started

January 16, 2024 ~ July 31, 2024

Total 1050 hours

It was a short yet long six months!

It feels like just yesterday when I was preparing for the AWS Cloud School interview.

I created a blog around May, intending to write posts about my experiences while attending the school, but here I am writing a blog post after it’s all over… TAT

## Why I Chose AWS Cloud School

While studying SAP for a month, I found myself more interested in other areas rather than accounting.

As I used SAP HANA S/4, I started wondering, ‘How is this server managed?’, ‘With SAP HANA S/4 moving to a web version, how did they migrate to the cloud?’ My curiosity about the infrastructure grew. I began researching how it was structured and came across Megazone Cloud’s SAP on AWS. The AWS architecture was briefly explained, but I didn’t understand any of it. Further searching led me to Samsung SDS’s Amorepacific SAP Migration Case which also utilized AWS for SAP implementation. Seeing LG CNS’s Kleannara SAP Migration, I realized it was a major focus for many big companies these days.

Then, in December 2023, I failed my final interview and was feeling lost, wondering ‘What should I do now?’ As I was about to start writing my resume, I saw the AWS Cloud School 4th cohort recruitment notice. The timing was perfect, so I applied immediately.

## 24 Hours of Interview Preparation

I applied, took the pre-test, and suddenly the interview was approaching! I didn’t know anything about the cloud, so I opened a book. Luckily, there was a book called “Starting with Cloud AWS Certification” on Millie’s Library, so I started reading it. I studied online with some friends, which helped me focus better. Listening to various explanations from different people made it easier to understand. Thanks to that, I was able to answer well in the interview.

I want to thank everyone who stayed up all night with me again.

The interview panel included an AWS employee, a network instructor, and a representative from the Korea Radio Promotion Association. It was a group interview, and the session with the AWS employee was particularly fun. They presented various scenarios, and the interviewees had to provide solutions. It was a new interview style and the back-and-forth was enjoyable.

As a result, I got accepted!
